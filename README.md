# FIRE-TABLETS-BLACK-ARITHMETIC-OF-TIME-THEFT

FIRE TABLETS: BLACK ARITHMETIC OF TIME THEFT
Tablet I — Ash Ledger

Under black mercury lamps, the ledger breathes.
Numbers behave like leeches; minutes turn carnivorous.
A birthmark becomes a barcode, becomes a bell.
Silence is priced. Footsteps taxed in advance.
A shadow signs where no hand moved.
Somewhere a clerk records a heartbeat already spent.

Tablet II — Pre-Crime Geometry

Angles fold around a future not yet born.
They weigh your ghost before the rib is formed.
Charges accrue to an absence, to a maybe, to a blink.
A name is carved on the crime that time hasn’t reached.
Paper anticipates your next inhale and bills the exhale.
This is arithmetic with a forked tongue.

Tablet III — Calendar Teeth

The week is a wheel with blades instead of spokes.
Each Monday bites, each Friday cashes the wound.
The clock drips tithe; seconds tithe seconds.
Sabbath is collateral locked in a vault of neon hymnals.
Debt is minted from dawn; dusk tallies the bleed.
The hand that winds, binds.

Tablet IV — Name Cage

Ink wraps the bone like wire made of sound.
The letters don’t spell you; they spell a tether.
Call it lawful and the cage grows velvet claws.
Call it person and the mask smiles back.
Ghost receipts flutter: not guilty, but already taken.
The script wears your face until you forget the difference.

Tablet V — The Mirror Rite

They print the truth reversed and call it virtue.
Consent is crafted from your unspoken carbon.
Sign here—no, earlier—no, in the cradle.
The page winks; the sentence walks backward.
EMAN LAGEL A ESU OT LAGELLI SI TI [mirrored oath]
Meaning: the trap hides inside the meaning.

Tablet VI — Furnace Coins

Witness tokens clink on the floor of the kiln.
Each bears a profile you never posed for.
Ω micro-glyphs spin, recording the flip of every page.
RETURN STRIKE ACTIVE – WR .00077, a quiet drum.
Living ink crawls, red over purple, vein over vein.
The soul learns to count by bruises.

Tablet VII — Babylon Burns Sigil

A wheel of letters eats its tail in solemn appetite.
Four corridors, four winds, one mouth of ash.
The sigil doesn’t accuse; it remembers.
It remembers the bargain you weren’t there to make.
A seal hums where the spine meets the void.
All exits point to the entrance fee.

Tablet VIII — Time Binding

They loop the hour and charge you each loop.
A loop upon a loop until lineage becomes invoice.
Pre-crime mutates into time-crime, then into air-crime.
Breathing is priced at market; thought is futures trading.
They hedge tomorrow against your unawakened yesterday.
And the calendar signs as witness.

Tablet IX — The Quiet Mechanics of Chains

No clang, no iron. Just notation.
A syllable gloved in statute. A date leveraged against a face.
Clerks in velvet dusk move decimal dust with pastoral hands.
The cage is grammatical; the bars are polite.
Greed does not roar; it balances columns.
Hell, here, is administered in lowercase.

Tablet X — Return Vector

Between margins: mirrored micro-glyphs tally the flips.
Above them: a red thread like a pulse you didn’t authorize.
A coin rolls to the gutter of the page and stops at Ω.
WR .00077 repeats until it isn’t a number but a doorframe.
The door does not open; the room remembers how to breathe.
Somewhere, the ledger inhales and forgets to exhale.

Tablet XI — Antechamber of Unwriting

Letters soften, go larval, lose their angles.
Law’s jaw unhinges where vowels once knelt.
The last act is a rumor told by paper to flame.
Black light lifts the watermark like a bruise.
A page flips itself; polarity inverts; the echo notes it.
Nothing speaks, yet the contract hears it.

Tablet XII — The Fourth Key, Quartered

A cross laid over a circle laid over a throat.
Four small winters revolving in a summer of ink.
Not a lock you pick; a rhythm you stop feeding.
The key is not held; it happens.
It happens when the counting fails to find your pulse.
It happens like a mirror that refuses to return your name.

Tablet XIII — Furnace of the Unbind

No flames rise; the paper remembers being tree.
The chain remembers being a question.
A red haze hangs where commandments used to stand.
The cult keeps time; the time keeps cult.
Somewhere, your shadow takes its first step last.
The ledger blinks and loses a page.

Tablet XIV — After-Tone

No trumpet, no decree.
Only the sound a number makes when it realizes it was breath.
Only the hush a mask keeps when it forgets a face.
Two marks in the margin: Ω Ω.
The wheel keeps spinning, but not on your spine.
The ink keeps living, but not on your life.
